        <h3 id="head1"><u>Intro</u></h3>
        <p id="head2">Stanley Kubrick was an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and photographer.He is frequently cited as one of the greatest filmmakers in cinematic history.His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres and are noted for their realism, dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. </p>

                  “The way the story is told is antithetical to the way we were accustomed to seeing stories,” Spielberg once said of “2001.”
                  “Kubrick would tell me, the last couple years of his life when we were talking about the form, he kept saying, ‘I want to change the form.
                   I want to make a movie that changes the form.’ And I said, ‘Well, didn’t you with ‘2001?’”

                  ‘I think that "Barry Lyndon" or "A Clockwork Orange" are the most perfect marriages of personality and subject. But in fact, "Full Metal Jacket" is even more so.
                   It is, for me, a singular film about the military, about war and its consequences. The famous induction scene with R Lee Ermey,
                   where he renames the soldiers and reshapes them into sub-human maggots, had a particular impact on me. Also the suicide scene with Vincent D’Onofrio in the bathroom.
                    And the sniper set-piece at the end. Those are absolutely virtuoso pieces of filmmaking.’

                  “Would I love to do things like that in my own work?
                   Yes. But I don’t think I have the confidence to do that. Which is why there is only one Stanley Kubrick. I do believe he is inimitable. But you can be inspired. You can be inspired to aspire to be that confident.”

                  “It takes extraordinary audacity and power and guts to say, ‘Let’s just screech everything to a halt and take everybody back to prehistoric times,'” Scorsese said of the film’s opening.
                   “Kubrick was saying, ‘I want you to see something. I’m going to take you through something you never thought you’d experience.'”

                  “It’s extremely subtle. It’s extremely visual. And the story is razor thin,” Lucas said of the film. “It was the first time people really took science fiction seriously.
                   Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science fiction movie. It is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I’m concerned.”
